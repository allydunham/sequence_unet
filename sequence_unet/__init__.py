"""
Python package for working with Sequence UNET (https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-023-02948-3), allowing easy use of pretrained models to predict coding variant effects, PSSMs and pathogenicity.
It also provides tools for training finetuned models for related tasks and initialising completely new models to apply the architecture to novel applications.
